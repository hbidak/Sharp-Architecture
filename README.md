## Templify / Visual Studio templates

Starting with version 4 solution templates are not maintained anymore. Main reason for this is a variaty of projects can be build based on S#Aarp Architecture. 
As usual, pull requests are welcome.

To learn how to get a S#arp Architecture solution up and running, please check the samples https://github.com/sharparchitecture/Sharp-Architecture/tree/develop/Samples.
